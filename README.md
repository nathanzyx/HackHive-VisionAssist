# HackHive-VisionAssist Updated
Integrates on-device AI models MediaPipe and YOLOv11 to combine hand-tracking and object recognition to read aloud the object a user is pointing at.

## Improvements made:
- Object detection box begins around tip of the pointer finger, rather than the center.
- Added Nvidia Cuda Core usage.
